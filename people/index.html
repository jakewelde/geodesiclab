				Dr. Jake Welde is an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/">Sibley School of Mechanical 
				and Aerospace Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>
				and a member of <a href="https://robotics.cornell.edu">Robotics@Cornell</a>.
				His research explores the role of differential geometry 
				and dynamical systems theory in control synthesis and design for robotic systems, exploiting 
				structural properties to explainably synthesize efficient controllers, accelerate learning 
				algorithms, and develop more capable robot morphologies. He envisions a future in which robots move through their surroundings as capably and dynamically as their counterparts in Nature.

				Prior to joining MAE at Cornell in 2025, Jake spent a decade at the 
				<a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>, 
				where he completed his undergraduate and doctoral degrees in Mechanical Engineering 
				and Applied Mechanics and his Masters in Robotics.
				His PhD thesis, 
				 <a href="/files/jake_welde_thesis.pdf">"Geometric Methods for Efficient and Explainable Control of Underactuated Robotic Systems"</a>, was completed in the 
				<a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu">GRASP Laboratory</a>. 
				Jake was a finalist for a Best Paper Award at ICRA (2021) and the recipient of a 
				National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2019). He has also been 
				recognized as an RSS Pioneer (2024) and has earned departmental awards for teaching 
				as well as scholarship, resourcefulness, and leadership.
