We are seeking highly-motivated students at all levels (undergrad, Masters, PhD) with interest in **control algorithms**, **structured machine learning**, **electromechanical design**, and **hands-on aerial robotics**. Projects range from mathematical research in control theory to hardware hacking with custom-built robots.  Ideal candidates will have strong mathematical preparation (control theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems), in-depth electromechanical design experience (PCB design, SolidWorks, Autodesk), and/or experience writing software for robotics (C++, Python, ROS). 

We are committed to building a research group in which all people can thrive, with mentorship as a central ingredient of the research process.

#### Ph.D. Students

**We are actively recruiting Ph.D. students for the 2025-2026 application cycle.**

If you are a current PhD student at Cornell interested in working in GeoDesiC Lab, you should reach out to Prof. Welde over email to discuss shared research interests and your academic background. If you are not yet at Cornell, you should apply to one of Cornell's Ph.D. programs in [Robotics](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/robotics-phd/), [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/mechanical-engineering-phd/), [Aerospace Engineering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/aerospace-engineering-phd/), [Theoretical and Applied Mechanics](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/theoretical-applied-mechanics-phd/), and/or [Applied Math](https://cam.cornell.edu/academics/phd-program/) and indicate Prof. Welde's name in your application. *You are welcome to reach out over email, but please know that the volume of inquiries makes it difficult for Prof. Welde to respond to all unsolicited requests from prospective students.*

####  M.S. and M.Eng. Students

We have some research opportunities for M.S. and M.Eng. students currently enrolled Cornell. Please reach out to Prof. Welde over email describing your academic preparation, the kind of research you are interested in, and any prior research experience you have.

#### Undergraduate Students

At the moment, we unfortunately have limited opportunities for undergraduate students, but these opportunities will definitely expand in the near future.

#### Postdoc Positions

We do not currently have any postdoc opportunities.
