We are seeking highly-motivated students at all levels (undergrad, Masters, PhD) with interest in **control algorithms**, **structured machine learning**, **electromechanical design**, and **hands-on aerial robotics**. Projects range from mathematical research in control theory to hardware hacking with custom-built robots.  Strong candidates will have robust mathematical preparation (control theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems), in-depth electromechanical design experience (PCB design, SolidWorks, Autodesk), and/or experience writing software for robotics (C++, Python, ROS). 

We are committed to building a research group in which all people can thrive, with mentorship as a central ingredient of the research process.

#### Ph.D. Students

**We are actively recruiting Ph.D. students for the 2025-2026 application cycle.**

If you are a current PhD student at Cornell interested in working in GeoDesiC Lab, you should reach out to Prof. Welde over email to discuss shared research interests and your academic background. If you are not yet at Cornell, you should apply to one of Cornell's Ph.D. programs in [Robotics](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/robotics-phd/), [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/mechanical-engineering-phd/), [Aerospace Engineering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/aerospace-engineering-phd/), [Theoretical and Applied Mechanics](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/theoretical-applied-mechanics-phd/), and/or [Applied Math](https://cam.cornell.edu/academics/phd-program/), indicating Prof. Welde's name in your application. 

*You are welcome to reach out over email, but please know that the volume of inquiries makes it difficult for Prof. Welde to respond in detail to all unsolicited inquiries from prospective students. Inquiries that demonstrate substantive engagement with the lab's goals, work, and priorities are much more likely to receive a substantive response.*

####  M.S. and M.Eng. Students

If you are an M.S. and M.Eng. students currently enrolled Cornell, please reach out to Prof. Welde over email describing your academic preparation, the kind of research you are interested in, and any prior research experience you have.

#### Undergraduate Students

At the moment, we have opportunities only for extremely motivated and independent undergraduate students. If you are such a student, please reach out! A broader range of opportunities for undergraduate students will become available in the future.

#### Postdoc Positions

We do not currently have any postdoc opportunities.
